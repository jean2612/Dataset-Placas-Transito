# Brazilian Traffic Signs in the Wild
The Brazilian Traffic Signs in the Wild (BTSW) dataset was collected using a GoPro camera mounted on a vehicle traveling through Brazilian roadways in Rio Grande do Sul and Bahia. The dataset consists of 3,613 images, divided into training and validation sets. However, it is possible for a single image to contain more than one object of interest, resulting in a total of 4,127 categorized traffic signs. The dataset includes three classes of signs provided in the Brazilian legislation: regulatory, warning, and informative. The data was cataloged in the YOLO format, which enables the training of machine learning systems for traffic sign recognition and detection. The BTSW is the larger publicly available collection of Brazilian traffic signs annotated with sign categories, YOLO format locations, and images captured in wild unconstrained real-world environments. 

Subject -	Computer Vision, Pattern Recognition, Artificial Intelligence, Computer Science.

Specific subject area -	Brazilian road traffic signs, visual dataset, image recognition, object detection.

Data format -	Raw images– (.jpg) Annotation Files – (.txt) in YOLO Format.

Type of data - Images, Annotations.

Data collection -	Road videos were collected using a GoPro7 camera, configured with Full HD resolution (1080p), mounted on a vehicle traveling on urban streets and roads. The recorded videos were converted into images using the FFmpeg software to enable the traffic signs' annotation. All annotation text files have the same name as the image files, and these annotations were created using the LabelImg software to label the objects of interest.

Data source location - City/Town/Region: States of Bahia and Rio Grande do Sul.
